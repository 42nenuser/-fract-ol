# -fract-ol
Fractol is a computer graphics project focused on generating and visualizing beautiful fractals. Implemented in C using the MiniLibX graphical library, this project explores mathematical fractals such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. It provides interactive controls for zooming, moving the view, and modifying fractal parameters dynamically.
